# CSCW2025-Materials

This repository contains supplementary materials related to a specific manuscript submitted to CSCW 2025. The resources provided here support the research presented in the manuscript, including anonymized dataset samples, code for standardizing user information, and core prompt code for conducting sentiment and topic analysis. These materials aim to offer a reproducible basis for the study and facilitate further exploration of the findings discussed in the paper.

## Contents

### 1. Anonymized Dataset Samples

We provide 10% samples from each of two datasets. These samples have been carefully anonymized to remove sensitive information, offering a secure and representative subset for analysis.  Samples with the suffix _1 are formed by resampling after truncating the dataset.

### 2. Username Anonymization Code

To standardize usernames across datasets, we include core code that replaces all usernames with the placeholder `@username`. This ensures consistency and privacy across the datasets.

### 3. Sentiment and Topic Analysis Prompt Code

For sentiment and topic analysis tasks, we provide core code for generating prompts. This code supports creating prompt-based tasks for sentiment and topic classification, enabling efficient and accurate model evaluation on these tasks.
